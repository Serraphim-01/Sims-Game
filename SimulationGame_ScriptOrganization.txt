## Simulation Game Script Organization

### 1. Core Categories

#### *Controllers*
- Manage player input, UI interactions, and game state changes.
- Examples:
  - GameController → Handles the overall game loop and state transitions.
  - UIController → Manages UI interactions (buttons, menus, etc.).
  - CharacterController → Handles player movement and animations.

#### *Managers*
- Handle global game systems like saving, audio, and event handling.
- Examples:
  - SceneManager → Handles scene loading and unloading.
  - AudioManager → Controls sound effects and background music.
  - SaveManager → Manages saving and loading game data.
  - EventManager → Handles game-wide events (Observer Pattern).

#### *Helpers (Utility Scripts)*
- Contain reusable functions that don’t belong to a single system.
- Examples:
  - MathHelper → Handles calculations (e.g., distance, rounding).
  - TimeHelper → Converts in-game time formats.
  - AnimationHelper → Utility functions for animations.

#### *Models (Data Structures)*
- Define data structures for characters, items, etc.
- Examples:
  - CharacterData → Stores character stats and attributes.
  - ItemData → Stores inventory item details.
  - QuestData → Stores missions and objectives.

#### *Game Systems (Simulation Logic)*
- Handles gameplay mechanics specific to your simulation.
- Examples:
  - EconomySystem → Manages income, expenses, and transactions.
  - WorkSystem → Handles job and skill progression.
  - NeedsSystem → Manages hunger, energy, and mood levels.
  - InteractionSystem → Handles object and NPC interactions.

#### *AI & NPCs*
- Manages NPC behavior and interactions.
- Examples:
  - AIController → Controls NPC logic and pathfinding.
  - DialogueSystem → Manages NPC conversations.
  - TaskScheduler → Controls NPC schedules (e.g., work, rest).

#### *UI & User Experience*
- Controls user interface and feedback systems.
- Examples:
  - HUDManager → Manages the game’s heads-up display.
  - NotificationSystem → Handles pop-up messages and alerts.
  - TooltipManager → Controls UI tooltips and descriptions.
